# 🖼️ Image Quality Enhancement with Histogram Visualization

This Python-based image processing project improves image quality using a series of enhancement techniques and visually displays the changes alongside histograms. It leverages OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for effective preprocessing and analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Read and display input images
- 🌞 Brightness and contrast adjustment
- 🧽 Noise reduction using Gaussian and bilateral filters
- 🧠 Feature enhancement with Gabor and Laplacian filters
- 📊 Histogram Equalization for better contrast
- 📈 Side-by-side visualization of original and processed histograms

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- **Brightness & Contrast Adjustment**  
- **Gaussian & Bilateral Filtering**  
- **Gabor Filtering for Texture Detection**  
- **Histogram Equalization (Grayscale)**  
- **Laplacian Filter for Edge Detection**

## 🖥️ Requirements

  Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy

## ▶️ Usage
1. **Update the image path in the script:**
    input_image_path = r'your_path'

2. **Run the script:**
    python your_script_name.py

3. **The script will display each processing step along with its histogram.**
