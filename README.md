# real-time-image-enhancement

This project is an Image Enhancement Tool developed in Python using libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 
It offers real-time adjustment of image parameters like brightness, contrast, and denoise strength, providing users with immediate visual feedback. 
The tool also includes interactive visualization of various image filters such as Gaussian blur, bilateral filter, and Gabor filter. Through its intuitive interface, users can dynamically enhance image quality and explore different filtering techniques. 
The project's GitHub repository facilitates collaboration and further development.
